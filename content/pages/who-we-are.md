  Boonzaaijer Bakery has been in Kalamazoo since 1961.  Karel Boonzaaijer immigrated here from the Netherlands with his family and opened a bakery that continued the tradition of fine baked goods begun by his father over 100 years ago.  Still family owned and operated, Boonzaaijer Bakery provides customers with delicious Bavarian filled cakes and baked goods made from Boonzaaijer's recipes and using the finest ingredients available.
